[Verse 1]
I like to wander some graveyards alone
And think of all that I始ve become
What kind of box I would go
And would you even notice
My disappearance, my impressions
I始m just waiting, waiting...

[Chorus]
And until then my desolation
Will be my trademark
I始ll always remain alien
And however hard I try to integrate
I始ll always remain alien
