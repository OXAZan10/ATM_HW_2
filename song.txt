[Verse 1]
I like to wander some graveyards alone
And think of all that Iʼve become
What kind of box I would go
And would you even notice
My disappearance, my impressions
Iʼm just waiting, waiting...

[Chorus]
And until then my desolation
Will be my trademark
Iʼll always remain alien
And however hard I try to integrate
Iʼll always remain alien

[Verse 2]
You say I should go out
In every brutal town
There is someone of substance
Forcing me to do things I never do
For instance laugh at jokes of you
Small talks have simply no relevance

[Chorus]
And until you change
Iʼll keep my delighted face
It is my trademark to always remain alien
And however hard I try to integrate
Iʼll always remain alien
